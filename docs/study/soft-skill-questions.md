1. What has been your most challenging project?

   - "I ask them to describe their most challenging project and then ask them to tell me how they would do it differently if they had to start it again tomorrow." – Erik Gustavson, Bitium

2. Can you explain the concept of the Web to a kid?

   - "Communication and the ability to express oneself in ways that are tailored to your audience are key. I simply ask a developer to explain what the Web is and how it works, as if I am an 8-year-old. I'm on a lookout for simple terms, meaningful analogies and clarifying statements. Also, the same exact question can be slightly tweaked to ask if the candidate gets the important concepts and sees the big picture." – Alex Zhitomirsky, Petplan

3. Tell me about a personal goal you were able to accomplish this past year.

   - "Self-improvement demonstrates a number of positive attributes about a candidate, including evaluation and problem solving. The ability to set and accomplish goals is a key indicator for success for any new hire." – Mark Shore, Strike Social

4. Tell me about a time you had a disagreement over the requirements.

   - Interpersonal skills and conflict resolution often differentiate good developers from great, well-rounded engineers. I look for opinionated engineers that use data and well-reasoned arguments to fight for what they believe in but who also know when to save the fight for another day." – Jason Carlson , LiquidPlanner

5. What do we do?

   - "The first thing I asked a pre-screened candidate is "What do we do?" This is a great opener, as it not only gives me a good indication of the candidate's understanding of the business, application and services provided, but also how engaged they are within the industry. It makes a great segue into then explaining the position in more detail and how it applies to the overall business." – Mark Edmondson, Guestfolio

6. Describe a time when you had to boil a very complex problem down into simple, clear language."

   - "If you can speak clearly, you can think clearly. Our developers face hugely complex problems spanning multiple areas of expertise, using several technologies and platforms, connected to dozens of APIs, with lots of dynamic logic. Candidates who have experience summarizing complicated problems prove they will be able to think clearly and effectively communicate with other members of the team." – Pete Kistler, BrandYourself.com

7. What are you reading?

   - "I like to ask developer candidates about the last good book they read. This non-technical question tends to shake things up a bit, and offers insight on the actual person you will be working with." – Chris Kirby, Voices.com

8. If you could take a one-day seminar in any subject, what would it be?

   - "As a follow-up question, I also ask: "If you could teach a seminar in any subject, what would it be?" A commitment to ongoing learning and teaching has proven to be a key trait for a successful developer. We look for developers who are driven to learn new things, but are also able to take what they've learned and share it with the rest of their team. This also exposes some of the other interests a candidate might have or non-technical areas of expertise that can benefit the organization." – Noah Gedrich, BLITZ

9. Can you tell me about us and what you think you like or might change?

   - "This tells us that the candidate has done research about the company before an interview. They may have identified competitors, market size, market opportunity, etc. If they able to articulate this well and are able to engage in a conversation, it’s a positive sign. If they stumble or don’t have an opinion, not so good." – Venkat Rangan, Clari Inc.

10. What's your favorite app?

    - "It sounds easy, but it’s a great question to get at the heart of how developers think about apps personally. I’m often surprised when people can’t answer the question, given how much time people spend on their phones. I’m always looking for candidates to go beyond boring answers, and it’s usually an easy way to determine their passion for the industry." – Jon Hyman, Appboy

11. What is your favorite web platform and how do you think it’s built?

    - "Great engineers are able to pick apart an architecture and explain how the pieces can come back together. If they like a given product, they should also be able to quickly access what nuances affect architecture. Dive deep into the data mode, architecture and scalability issues. This is a proxy of how the engineer approaches a big problem and how well they know how to use their tools." – Dmitry Koltunov, ALICE

12. Tell me about yourself.

    - I love this question because it is very open and the conversation can go anywhere. A candidate should be able to answer this easily. If a candidate does not know themselves, how is an employer supposed to know? It allows the candidate to take control and impress a potential employer." – Chalmers Brown, Due
    - "What" you are professionally, combined with "who" you are as a person (attributes) = "why" I am a good candidate for this role.

13. Why did you leave your last role/why do you want to leave your current role?

    - Do not speak badly of companies or senior management.

14. Why do you want to work for this company?

    - Thoroughly research the company website, departments, management structure, competitors.
    - Review Bloomberg, FT, Wall Street Journal, etc. for mention of the company over the past 6 months. Review employee testimonials on Glassdoor.
    - Choose 4 points about the company and state why they appeal to YOU.

15. What is your understanding of this role?

    - Choose 4 key points that you have interpreted from the job description.

16. How will you add value to this company?

    - Relate strengths, transferable skills and achievements to the job requirements.

17. What is your salary expectation?
    - "I am sure a company such as ‘x’ pays fair market value for this role. What budget do you have in mind?" Check LinkedIn averages.
    - If forced to give a number, give a range and state that you are open to negotiation and incentivisation based on the growth of the company.
