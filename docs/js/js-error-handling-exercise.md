## Objective

In this exercise, we will be practicing error handling in JavaScript by implementing **selective catching**, **strict mode** and `try/catch/finally` blocks.

## Steps

### Getting Started

Exercise Repo: [JS Error Handling](https://github.com/Bryantellius/JavaScript_Error_Handling)

1. Open your command line and navigate to your repos directory (if you do not have a repos folder, then you can use mkdir repos to create one)
2. Use this template repository to start a new project in your repos folder: `git clone <repo_link>`
3. cd repo_name to navigate into your new repo directory
4. Start Visual Studio Code and select 'Open Folder'. Then select repo_name to open the folder in the editor (or just type code . in your terminal inside the repo directory)
5. Follow the instructions on the README.md file to complete exercises
6. Open the app.js file to get started

### Exercise 1: Enable Strict Mode

Complete the following in your `app.js` file

1. Enable JavaScript's "Strict Mode" for the _file_

### Exercise 2: Using Try/Catch

Complete the following in your `app.js` file

1. Add a try/catch block in the function body
2. Try to return the data parsed to JSON
3. Catch any raised exceptions
4. If an exception is caught:
   1. Print the error to the console
   2. Return null

### Exercise 3: Function Syntax Debugging

Complete the following in your `app.js` file

1. There is a problem with the function syntax. Fix the issue before you finish.

> HINT: The issue will cause `data` to be read as `null`.

### On Complete

When you are finished, your console should resemble the following:

```txt
null
{ success: true }
```
