## Getting Started

Exercise Repo: [JavaScript Loops](https://github.com/Bryantellius/JavaScript_Selections_Loops)

1. Open your command line and navigate to your repos directory (if you do not have a repos folder, then you can use mkdir repos to create one)
2. Use this template repository to start a new project in your repos folder: `git clone <repo_name>`
3. `cd repo_name` to navigate into your new repo directory
4. Start Visual Studio Code and select 'Open Folder'. Then select `repo_name` to open the folder in the editor (or just type `code .` in your terminal inside the repo directory)
5. Follow the instructions on the README.md file to complete exercises
6. Open the `app.js` file to get started

## Exercise 1: Ignore Even

In this exercise, you will be counting from 1 - 100. For each odd number, you will print the number to the console. If the number is even, do nothing.

1. Create a `for` loop that evaluates numbers from 1 to 100.
2. Inside the loop body, write an `if/else` selection statement that checks whether a number is odd
3. If the number is odd, then print the number to the console, otherwise do nothing and continue to the next number

## Exercise 2: FIZZBUZZ

FIZZBUZZ is a very common coding interview problem. Below are the instructions to solving the problem:

1. Create a `for` loop that evaluates numbers from 1 to 100 like the problem above.
2. Write a `if/else` selection statement inside the body of the the loop that checks the following:
   - If the number is divisible by 3, then console.log `'FIZZ'`
   - If the number is divisible by 5, then console.log `'BUZZ'`
   - If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, then console.log `'FIZZBUZZ'`

Ex: `15` would print `'FIZZBUZZ'`, `33` would print `'FIZZ'`, and `35` would print `'BUZZ'`
